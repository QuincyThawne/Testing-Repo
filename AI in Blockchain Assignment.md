### **1. Explain the Concept of Distributed Database and Digital Ledger**

**CO1 | Bloom’s Level: K2**

A **distributed database** is a database in which data is stored across multiple physical locations, which could be on different computers or networks. It provides high availability, fault tolerance, and improved performance.

* **Key Features:**

  * Data is stored and managed on different sites.
  * Each node can process queries independently.
  * Uses replication and fragmentation for consistency.

A **digital ledger** is a system for recording transactions electronically in a secure, immutable, and transparent way. It’s the foundation of blockchain technology.

* **Characteristics:**

  * Immutable records (cannot be altered once recorded).
  * Transparent and traceable.
  * Cryptographically secure.
  * Shared across a network (like in blockchain).

**Example:** Blockchain is a digital ledger where each block contains a list of transactions and is secured via cryptography.

### **2. Write about Blockchain Technology and Types of Blockchain in Detail**

**CO1 | Bloom’s Level: K2**

**Blockchain Technology** is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers. It ensures that the recorded transactions cannot be altered retroactively.

* **Key Components:**

  * **Blocks**: Contains data, hash, and previous block hash.
  * **Chain**: Sequence of blocks.
  * **Consensus Mechanism**: Ensures agreement among distributed nodes.

**Types of Blockchain:**

1. **Public Blockchain**:

   * Open to anyone.
   * Fully decentralized.
   * Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum.

2. **Private Blockchain**:

   * Access is restricted.
   * Controlled by a single organization.
   * Example: Hyperledger Fabric.

3. **Consortium Blockchain**:

   * Controlled by a group of organizations.
   * Used in banking and supply chains.
   * Example: R3 Corda.

4. **Hybrid Blockchain**:

   * Combines public and private features.
   * Offers controlled access with public transparency.

### **3. Describe about Hyperledger and Hyperledger Fabric and Frameworks**

**CO1 | Bloom’s Level: K3**

**Hyperledger** is an open-source collaborative project initiated by the Linux Foundation to support the development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers.

* **Goals of Hyperledger:**

  * Advance cross-industry blockchain technologies.
  * Provide modular frameworks.
  * Support performance and scalability.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a specific framework under Hyperledger designed for use in enterprise contexts.

* **Key Features:**

  * Modular architecture.
  * Pluggable consensus mechanisms.
  * Support for private channels.
  * Chaincode (smart contract) execution in containers.

**Other Hyperledger Frameworks:**

1. **Hyperledger Sawtooth**:

   * Modular, uses Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).
   * Developed by Intel.

2. **Hyperledger Iroha**:

   * Simple blockchain infrastructure.
   * Focused on mobile applications.

3. **Hyperledger Besu**:

   * Ethereum-compatible.
   * Supports public and private networks.

4. **Hyperledger Indy**:

   * Focused on decentralized identity.
