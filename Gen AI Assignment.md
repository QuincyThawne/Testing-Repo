### **1. Design a CNN architecture for detecting objects in images. (K6)**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture commonly used for image-related tasks due to its ability to capture spatial and temporal dependencies through the application of relevant filters. For object detection in images, a CNN needs to not only classify what is in the image but also localize where the object is.

**Example CNN Architecture for Object Detection:**

* **Input Layer:** Accepts an image input, e.g., size 224x224x3 (RGB image).

* **Convolutional Layers:** Use multiple layers with increasing depth. For instance:

  * Conv Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation
  * MaxPooling Layer: 2x2 pool size
  * Conv Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU
  * MaxPooling Layer

* **Deeper Conv Layers:** Add 128 or 256 filters to capture more complex features.

* **Flattening:** Flatten the output of the convolutional layers.

* **Fully Connected Layers:** Add dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.

* **Output Layer:** Depending on the task:

  * For classification: Softmax activation with N classes
  * For detection (e.g., bounding boxes): Output could be `[class, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]` with appropriate activation (sigmoid for coordinates)

**Popular Architectures:**

* **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Real-time object detection by dividing the image into grids.
* **Faster R-CNN:** Two-stage detector with region proposal network (RPN) and classifier.
* **SSD (Single Shot Detector):** Combines the speed of YOLO with accuracy of R-CNN.

These models combine CNN backbones like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet with custom heads for bounding box regression and classification.

### **2. Evaluate the trade-offs between convergence speed and stability for different optimizers (K5)**

Optimizers are algorithms or methods used to change the attributes of the neural network such as weights and learning rate to reduce losses. Popular optimizers include **SGD**, **Momentum**, **RMSProp**, **Adam**, and **Adagrad**.

**Convergence Speed:**

* **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent):** Slower convergence but offers better generalization. Requires careful tuning of learning rate.
* **Momentum SGD:** Accelerates convergence by adding a fraction of the previous update, useful in deep networks with local minima.
* **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):** Combines RMSProp and Momentum. Fastest convergence in most cases, especially on large datasets.
* **RMSProp:** Adjusts learning rate dynamically for each parameter. Effective in non-stationary environments.

**Stability:**

* **Adam and RMSProp** tend to provide stable training with smaller learning rates and adaptive tuning.
* **SGD** without momentum may oscillate or diverge if the learning rate is too high.
* **Adagrad** often becomes too conservative in later stages, leading to slow convergence or stagnation.

**Trade-offs:**

* Adam is preferred for faster results, but it can lead to overfitting.
* SGD might be slower but results in models that generalize better.
* Choice depends on task complexity, dataset size, and computational resources.

### **3. Analyze the impact of learning rate on the effectiveness of backpropagation (K4)**

The **learning rate** is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. It is critical for the success of backpropagation.

**Too High Learning Rate:**

* May cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution or even diverge.
* Can lead to **overshooting** the minimum and unstable training.

**Too Low Learning Rate:**

* Training becomes extremely slow.
* Risk of getting stuck in local minima.
* May not reach global optimum within reasonable epochs.

**Ideal Learning Rate:**

* Balances speed and stability.
* Allows the gradient descent to converge steadily.

**Learning Rate Scheduling:**

* Reduce learning rate on plateau or use step decay to gradually decrease the rate.
* **Warm restarts** or **cosine annealing** are advanced techniques used in modern deep learning.

**Visualization Tools:**

* Plotting training loss over epochs helps detect if the learning rate is optimal.
* Techniques like **Learning Rate Finder** can help choose the best initial rate.

### **4. Design a deep neural network architecture for image recognition (K6)**

A deep neural network (DNN) for image recognition generally involves multiple layers to extract and learn complex features of the image. The architecture typically includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

**Example Architecture:**

* **Input Layer:** Image input (e.g., 128x128x3)

* **Conv Block 1:**

  * Conv2D: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU
  * MaxPooling2D

* **Conv Block 2:**

  * Conv2D: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU
  * MaxPooling2D

* **Conv Block 3:**

  * Conv2D: 128 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU
  * MaxPooling2D

* **Flatten Layer**

* **Dense Layer:** 512 units with ReLU

* **Dropout:** 0.5 for regularization

* **Output Layer:** Softmax for multi-class classification

**Common Choices:**

* Use pretrained models like **VGGNet**, **ResNet**, **Inception**, or **EfficientNet** for transfer learning.
* For small datasets, data augmentation and regularization techniques are crucial.

**Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy
**Optimizer:** Adam or SGD
**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

### **5. How would you apply an RNN to a time series prediction task? (K3)**

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for time series prediction where temporal dependencies are crucial.

**Steps to apply RNN for Time Series Prediction:**

1. **Preprocessing:**

   * Normalize the data (e.g., MinMaxScaler).
   * Convert time series into sequences (sliding window technique).

2. **Input Structure:**

   * Create input-output pairs where each input is a sequence of past time steps, and output is the next time step value.

3. **Model Architecture:**

   * **Input Layer:** Shape `[batch_size, time_steps, features]`
   * **RNN/LSTM/GRU Layer:** Choose RNN variant. LSTM/GRU are better for long-term dependencies.
   * **Dense Output Layer:** For regression tasks, use linear activation.

4. **Training:**

   * Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   * Optimizer: Adam

5. **Prediction:**

   * Use the trained model to predict the next time step recursively.
   * For multi-step forecasting, either repeat predictions or train specifically for multi-output.

**Use Cases:**

* Stock price forecasting
* Energy demand prediction
* Weather forecasting

**Enhancements:**

* Use **Bidirectional RNNs** or **Stacked LSTMs**
* Add **Dropout** to prevent overfitting
* Combine with CNN for feature extraction in complex sequences
